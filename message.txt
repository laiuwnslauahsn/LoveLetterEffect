“Caicai, I miss you so much. I’m sorry if I’ve been so busy lately. I really wish we were the same age, or that our timelines were more aligned so we could spend more time together. Ayaw kalimti nga mag-focus sa imong school ug futsal. Keep pushing forward, I know you can do it! Always remember to eat well, take care of yourself. Don’t forget to bring your umbrella, water, and extra shirt para ready ka anytime.If you ever miss me, just listen to the songs I gave you – it might make you feel a little closer to me. I want you to know that I’m always here, supporting you, and rooting for you. You really one of the persons that inspire me the most cai, and I’m so grateful that I met you. I feel so blessed to have you in my life. Stay strong, Langga.”
